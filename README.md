# Toon Water Shader

Water shader styled after GameCube-era water effects. Created from scratch using Unity ShaderLab. All textures created by me except for *WaterDistortion.png*, sourced from [this tutorial](https://roystan.net/articles/toon-water.html). All code is my own, except for code snipped modified from the same tutorial. 

Heavily inspired by the video [How scrolling textures gave Super Mario Galaxy 2 its charm](https://youtu.be/8rCRsOLiO7k) by Jasper Ashworth, who demonstrated how Nintendo utilized textures to create some great effects. 

Features customizable scroll speed, distortion effects, and surface noise generation.

Future additions include foam around the rim, simulated waves, transparency, and splashes for objects moving through the water.

Created as a project for Computer Graphics II. 

Unity ver 2019.4.16f1
